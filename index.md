Thank you for taking the time to review this brief display of my skills and qualifications for the position. I am excited to show you what I have to offer!


**About the Portfolio**

All relevant files can be found in my public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dominicgrossi/Allstate-Interview-Portfolio). The repository contains two macro-enabled workbooks. Two macro-enabled Excel applications are included in my repository. One is a tool that plays out a the six-sided dice rolling component of the popular tabletop game Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. 
The other macro was a tool I developed to produce simulated call-center data. This tool was used to generate all data used for the Oracle, SQL and Tableau samples included within my repository. 



**Excel Macro**

[The Macro](https://github.com/Dominicgrossi/Allstate-Interview-Portfolio/tree/master/Mock%20Call%20Center%20DB) serves as a workbook for a simulated call-center environment. The macro within the workbook generates simulated call center data. The sheets in the workbook were created for the SQL demonstration. They were intended to have separate foreign keys so that they could be joined within OracleSQL Developer


**Oracle Database and SQL**

Simulated call center data was uploaded to a local Oracle XE database for SQL manipulation via Oracle SQL Developer interface. From here, a query was ran to create a table, that joined all four originally uploaded tables from Excel. The fifth table called CustomerInteractions, was used for the Tableau sample

**Tableau**

Using the joined table that was created in OracleSQL Developer, I produced three charts that visualize data based on call length and call volume. These files were uploaded to Tableau Public, and are also available in my repository. The three tableau tables show the relationships between:

1.[Employee Average daily call time](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dominic.grossi#!/vizhome/AllstatePortfolio/EmployeeAvg_CallTime?publish=yes)

2.[Average Call Length to customers contacted](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dominic.grossi#!/vizhome/AllstatePortfolio2/AvgCLCustomersContacted?publish=yes)

3.[Total Call Hours across 5 days](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dominic.grossi#!/vizhome/AllstatePortfolio3/Totalcallhours5day?publish=yes)
