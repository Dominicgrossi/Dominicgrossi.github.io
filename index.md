Thank you for taking the time to review this brief display of my skills and qualifications for the position. I am excited to show you what I have to offer!

<title>About the Portfolio</title>
All relevant files can be found in my public GitHub repo [submit an issue](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site/issues). The repository contains two macro-enabled workbooks. The AoS roller simulates rounds of dice rolling for the popular table top game, Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. The second workbook is a project I created specifically for this position. 

<title>About the Portfolio</title>
The macro serves as a workbook for a simulated call-center environment. The macro within the workbook generates simulated call center data. This randomly generated data was used to create four distinct tables within an Oracle database I set up.
